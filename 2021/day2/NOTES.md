My first ever golang program!!

Lots of things I don't like right off the bat XD

the boiler plate for doing something so basic as to read open a file and print the output
is a bit much - python got that right

I'm sure there's a reason as to why I always have to use := first and = later - but, man, it's
annoying - I hate it when subtle syntax changes like that matter

I'm not a big fan of the case conventions, either - it's weird that is jumps out at me right away

The day job is nodejs, and there is CamelCasing there, too - but I guess it's reserved 
for the OO-ish stuff - not for function names, like `split` or `open` / `ReadFile`

I should do one of these in nodejs - it is the day job right now, after all
