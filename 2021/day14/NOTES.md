You can tell on this one it took me a while to realize how to think about part b

was thinking of expansion instead of thinking about the fact that every pair creates two new pairs ...
... and then you just need to count the pairs as they are created ...

... and then you sum the letters once you know the total number of pairs

Also pair generation will change the first pair, so you need to keep track of what's first so you
know how to de-dupe the character count appropriately
