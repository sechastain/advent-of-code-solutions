path finding is evil

in the dark recesses of my brain is djikstra's algorithm

I refused to look it up at the time ... I'd like to revisit this problem later and see if I can 
get it properly implemented

this implementation is a memory beast

it won't run if you prefer the shortest available for your next search path

it will need about 12 GB of heap space if you prefer the longest available for your next search path

whatever, it works - 5 minutes and 12 GB memory - clearly some room for improvement :sweat_smile:
