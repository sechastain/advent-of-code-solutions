Part 2 took a little longer because I thought my code was more re-usable between the two parts

I kinda feel like that needs to be a focus on the puzzles going forward ... trying to 
properly modularize it so that my functions are clean and purely re-usable between challenge parts

I could have been closer, I think, if I gave it more time - I'll give the two parts another look
before I start tomorrow to see if I can spot a pattern for improvement
